An updated version of my website using HTML5, ES6 Javascript and SASS.

Design
======

Common to all the pages will be a nav bar that is sticky to the top of the
viewport. The number of items in the nav bar should be kept to a clean
minimum:

- Home
- Projects
- Blog/Posts
- Music (Optional)
- Reference (Optional)

Main Page
---------

I want the main page to be fairly clean. Front and center should be an image of
me and pointers to my various public accounts (twitter, github, bitbucket,
etc).

In an expandable container should be a biography write up about myself.
